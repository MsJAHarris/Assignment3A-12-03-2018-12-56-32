# Problem Description:
# Please create a flowchart, IPO chart and trace table for a particular error you had while creating

# the trace table to that (now fixed) code.
#
# Your task:
# Create ONE of TWO games using the Card class you and your classmates created.

# matching game.  Consider that Hearts and Diamonds match (red) and Spades and Clubs match (Black).
# You must use at least a 5 x 5 set of cards and  the entire deck.is at your disposal.  You will need
# complete instructions for your user.
#
# b)	More difficult option, (full marks possible). You will create the game of 21 or Blackjack,
